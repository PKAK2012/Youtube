Overview
This dataset contains information on various YouTube videos, including their rank, number of views, likes, dislikes, category, and publication year. 
The goal is to analyze video performance and predict key metrics based on available features.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following columns:
Rank : The ranking of the video based on engagement metrics (views, likes, etc.).
Video : The title or name of the video.
Video Views : The total number of views the video has received.
Likes : The total number of likes the video has received.
Dislikes : The total number of dislikes the video has received.
Category : The category of the video (e.g., Music, Entertainment).
Published : The year in which the video was published.

Objective:

This dataset can be used for various analytical and machine learning tasks, including:
Predicting the number of likes a video will receive based on views, category, and publication year.
Analyzing trends in video popularity over different years.
Understanding the relationship between video views, likes, and dislikes.
Identifying patterns in different video categories.

Machine Learning Approach

Supervised Learning (Regression)
Since the number of likes depends on other features such as views, category, and publication year, this dataset can be used for a supervised learning regression problem.
Target Variable: Likes
Independent Features: Video Views, Category, Published, etc.
